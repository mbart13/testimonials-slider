This is another challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io, where goal is to make the page looking as close to the design as possible.

Here the main challenge was making page responsive. I tried to avoid using set widths and heights and let content shrink/grow.
The tricky part was to make text overflow image to match the design.

For slider initially I wanted to make a classic carousel, but in the end I opted for these simple, but very cool transitions.

In this project I used:
- SASS
- Flexbox
- mobile-first approach
- JavaScript for slider
